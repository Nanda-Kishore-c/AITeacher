Okay, let’s talk about computers! Basically, a computer is like a team of parts working together to do things for you. It’s made of both hardware – the physical pieces like the screen, keyboard, and the processor – and software – the instructions that tell the hardware what to do.

Think of it like this: you want to bake a cake. The hardware is like your oven, mixer, and ingredients.
