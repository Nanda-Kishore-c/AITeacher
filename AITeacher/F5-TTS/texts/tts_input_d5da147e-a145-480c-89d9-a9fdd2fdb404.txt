The memory unit plays a crucial role by storing these instructions and data, enabling the CPU to access information rapidly and efficiently. Input devices, like a scanner, allow data to be entered into the computer, and the CPU then processes this input. Output devices, such as a monitor, display the results of the processing, showing the user what the computer has calculated or produced.
