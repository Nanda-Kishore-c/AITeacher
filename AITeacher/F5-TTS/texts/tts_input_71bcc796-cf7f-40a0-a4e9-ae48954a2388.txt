Simultaneously, the CPU manages memory, which is a larger storage area used to hold programs and data persistently. This memory is organized into locations that the CPU can access quickly. The CPU communicates with memory using addresses, which are unique identifiers for each storage location. The CPU fetches data from memory when needed and writes data back to memory when itâ€™s finished using it.
