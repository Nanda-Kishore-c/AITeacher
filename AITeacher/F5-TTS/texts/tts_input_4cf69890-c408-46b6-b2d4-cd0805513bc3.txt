When you add numbers, decide if one number is bigger than another, or do any kind of calculation, thatâ€™s the ALU at work. The second part is the Control Unit. This is like the manager of the CPU; it directs all the other parts, making sure everything happens in the right order. It fetches instructions, tells the ALU what to do, and moves data around. Finally, we have the Memory Registers.
