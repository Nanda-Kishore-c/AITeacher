Each location in RAM has an address, like a house number, so the CPU can quickly find the information it needs. Finally, the CPU needs a way to communicate the results of its work to you, and that’s where output units come in. These take the binary data the CPU produces and convert it into a format you can understand, whether it’s text on a monitor, an image on a printer, or sound from speakers.
