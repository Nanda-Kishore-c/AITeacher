A key aspect of the CPU’s function is its ability to handle memory, which is a larger storage area used to hold programs, data, and instructions. This memory is typically accessed through an address bus, allowing the CPU to quickly locate specific pieces of information. The computer’s memory, often referred to as RAM, is volatile, meaning that the data is lost when the power is turned off.
