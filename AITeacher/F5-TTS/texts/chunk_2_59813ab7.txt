You can think of the CPU as the ‘brain’ of the computer. It’s responsible for carrying out the instructions. Then there’s the **Memory Unit**, or MU, which holds the information and instructions that the CPU needs. 

A really important part of the CPU is the **Arithmetic Logic Unit**, or ALU. The ALU is like a calculator; it does all the math and logical comparisons.
