Input devices, such as the keyboard and mouse, allow users to interact with the computer, sending instructions and data to the CPU. Similarly, the scanner converts physical documents into digital data that the CPU can process. The computer's architecture is designed to facilitate this continuous flow of information, with each component playing a crucial role in the overall operation.
