Memory, often referred to as RAM, serves as a temporary storage location for data and instructions that the computer needs to access quickly. This memory is divided into various locations, each with a specific address, allowing the computer to pinpoint exactly where to find information. The ALU is the heart of the computerâ€™s processing capabilities, performing calculations and logical operations.
