All these components work together in a continuous loop. The input provides the raw material, the CPU processes it according to instructions, and then the output, like what you see on the screen or hear through the speakers, is the result. Underneath all of this, the computer operates using something called Instruction Set Architecture, which is essentially the language the CPU understands.
