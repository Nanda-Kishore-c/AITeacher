The Central Processing Unit, or CPU, is often called the brain of the computer because it is the control center and processes the input data. Inside the CPU is the Arithmetic Logic Unit, or ALU, which performs calculations such as addition, subtraction, and division. The Control Unit, or CU, manages and directs the operations performed by the ALU and other components.
