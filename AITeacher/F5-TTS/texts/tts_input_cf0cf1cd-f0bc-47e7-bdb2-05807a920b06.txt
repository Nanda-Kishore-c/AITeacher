Once the information is inside, it goes to the Central Processing Unit, or CPU. This is often called the “brain” of the computer because it’s where all the calculations and decisions happen. The CPU isn’t one single piece, though; it’s made up of two main parts. The first is the Control Unit, or CU, which directs the flow of information and tells the other parts of the computer what to do.
